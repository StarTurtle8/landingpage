            <p class="quotetext">You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube. According to Horadric lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric Staff.

            To do it - use the Cube as you would a scroll. When the Cube opens, place both pieces of the Staff into it and use the Cube's transmute power.
            
            You'll be pleased to know that the Cube has other alchemical uses as well...
            
            Six gems plus one sword transmute into a socketed long sword.
            
            You may also transmute two quivers of arrows into crossbow bolts into one quiver of arrows, while two quivers of arrows yield one quiver of bolts.
            
            I must leave it to you to discover other formulae.</p>
